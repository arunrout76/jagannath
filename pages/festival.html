            <img src="../images/demo/gallery/kalinga.jpg" width="800"/>

The festival is a tribute to the martyrs of the Maurya Dynasty which is celebrated by various Martial Art Acts through dance and music.</p>
            <p>Kalinga (the major part of present Indian state of Odisha (Orissa)) once witnessed the bloodiest battles in the history of India by the Emperor Ashoka of Maurya Dynasty. He became a changed man from this place as he realized the hollowness of his victory. A Buddhist monk named Upagupta help him to enlighten peace over sword.</p>

            <img src="../images/demo/gallery/makar1.jpg" height="400" width="400"/>
            <p>Makar Sankranti or Makar Mela is another important festival of Orrisa. The festival is celebrated when the Sun enters the orbit of Capricorn and by this time harvest of new paddy, sugarcane crops are over. On this auspicious day, people of Orissa offer prayers and food to the Sun God to have a healthy and prosperous life.</p>
            <p>A destination famous for its culture and folk dance- Odisha is also home to various kinds of festivals but one of the major festival is Makar Sankranti. Even though this harvest festival is celebrated almost in every state of India, but what is special in the celebration of Odisha is that- firstly this festival is very near to the traditional new year of Odisha and secondly, it holds an astronomical importance for those who believe that life is affected by the movement of celestial bodies. Since the celebrations take place in every district of Odisha but few places have a view of relish forever. To witness the grand celebrations, one must visit Hatakeshwar at Atri in Khordha or attend the special rituals at Jagannath in Puri, Dhabaleswar at Cuttack,Makara Muni Temple in Balasore.</p>

             <img src="../images/demo/gallery/saraswati.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
        <p>Vasanta Panchami (ବସନ୍ତ ପଞ୍ଚମୀ) occurs on the fifth day of the first lunar fortnight of Magha month (Magha Shukla Panchami), which usually falls in January or February. It is also observed as Saraswati Puja. Saraswati is the goddess of knowledge and wisdom in Hinduism. Traditionally, children get their letters on this day. Many educational institutions also observe the festival. It also marks the arrival of spring.</p>
        <p>Vasant Panchami, also spelled Basant Panchami, is a festival that marks the preliminary preparations for the arrival of spring, celebrated by people in various ways depending upon the region in the Indian subcontinent. The Vasant Panchami also marks the start of preparation for Holika and Holi, which take place forty days later.[5] The Vasant Utsava (festival) on Panchami is celebrated forty days before Spring, because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that the season comes in to full bloom.</p>
        <p>Vasant Panchami is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the bright half of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month of Magha, which typically falls in late January or February. Spring is known as the "King of all Seasons", so the festival commences forty days in advance. (It is generally winter-like in northern India, and more spring-like in central and western parts of India on Vasant Panchami, which gives credence to the fact that Spring is actually in full bloom 40 days after the Vasant Panchami day).</p>

On this day thousands of people gather on the shore of Bay of Bengal to offer their prayers to the sea. Devotees take a holy dip in the sea near Chandrabhaga beach and welcome the rising Sun with prayers. This festival also marks the beginning of grand fair at Khandagiri near Bhubaneswar which lasts for a week. The shore of Bay and Bengal and the offerings made to the Sun temple add the feeling of festivity among the people of Odisha.</p>

            <header class="heading">6. HAPPY HOLI(ଦୋଳ ଯାତ୍ରା)</header>
             <img src="../images/demo/gallery/holi.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
        <p>It also known as Dola Yatra, a five day long Dola Purnima festival celebrated with pomp and fervor across the state. Followed by Dola Purnima comes Holi. On this day, the Oriya calendar becomes ready and is offered to the deity Jagannath, who is also known as Dolagovinda. The celebration is mostly celebrated in Villages where Idols of Krishna and Radha come to a common place.</p>
        <p>The tradition followed in Orissa is quite similar to that of West Bengal with only minor region specific changes. For instance, Holi assumes the name of 'Dol Purnima' here also, but instead of placing the idols of Krishna and Radha on the swing they place the idol of Lord Jagannath. This is so because of the famous temple of Jagannath at Puri. Besides, Jagannath is only a synonym of Krishna.</p>
        <p>The palanquin - with the idol of Lord Jagannath on it is taken out in a procession around the main streets of the city. Devotees take turn to swing it while women dance around it and sing devotional songs. All this while men keep spraying coloured water and colour powder, 'abeer' at them.</p>
        <header class="heading">Celebrations by milkmen</header>
        <p>In the evening, milkmen, 'gwalas' carry the palanquin on their shoulders, for Krishna belonged to their clan. Games such as Dandi Khela are also played to mark the occasion. A special tent called 'jhoolan mandap' is erected to place the idol of Lord Jagannath at night. The following morning abeer is applied of the idol of the lord. Thereafter, people relish the special delicacies of the occasion such as pethas, laddoos made of puffed rice and sesame seed and play with colours. Towards evening, idols are given a dip in a pond and taken back to temple.</p>
        <p>Here too, Holika is burnt in the evening as a symbol pf victory of good over evil. Later, married women carefully sweep away the ashes of the bonfire, to mark the spot with drawings made out of a paste of powdered sun dried rice and water.</p>

            <header class="heading">7. CHHAU FESTIVAL</header>
            <center><img src="../images/demo/gallery/chhau.jpg" width="800"/></center>
            <p>To represent the tribal life and traditional dances of Orissa, Chhau festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm in the whole of Orrisa. This festival is primarily attached to the Odissi dance form- Mayurbhanj Chhau. During this festival, people of Orissa worship Lord Shiva. The trained classical dancers perform the act of Chhau with masks covering their faces. The dance form has various classical and martial arts elements in it. Chhau festival offers a complete treat of dance performances, great food and vibrant tribal life of Odisha.</p>
            <p>The Chhau dance is mainly performed during festivals in the region of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha, especially the spring festival of Chaitra Parva and in which the whole community participates. The Purulia Chhau dance is celebrated during the Sun festival.</p>
            <p>Masks form an integral part of Chhau dance in Purulia and Seraikella styles. The knowledge of dance, music and mask-making is transmitted orally. The Chhau dance found in northern Odisha does not use mask during the dance, but they do when the artists first appear on the stage for introduction to the audience.</p>
            <p>The two styles of Chhau dance that use masks, blend within it forms of both dance and martial practices employing mock combat techniques (called khel), stylized gaits of birds and animals (called chalis and topkas) and movements based on the chores of village housewives (called uflis). This form of the Chhau dance, states Mohan Khokar, has no ritual or ceremonial meaning, it is a form of community celebration and entertainment.</p>
            <p>The dance is performed by male dancers, at night in an open space, called akhada or asar. The dance is rhythmic and set to traditional folk music, played on the reed pipes mohuri and shehnai. A variety of drums accompany the music ensemble including the dhol (a cylindrical drum), dhumsa (a large kettle drum) and kharka or chad-chadi. The themes for these dances include local legends, folklore and episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata and other abstract themes.</p>

             <img src="../images/demo/gallery/panasankranti.jpg" height="800" width="800"/>
            <P>Mahabisuva Sankranti is celebrated to mark the new year as per the Odia Calendar in the month of April. The festival is also known as Pana Sankranti. Pana- a drink made from Misri and water is hung over the Tulsi plant to represent the rain. This festival is very auspicious for farming and agricultural activities in Orrisa. On this day special offerings are made to Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, and Hanuman. Devotees pay a visit to the Devi temples and pray for their great year ahead.</P>
            <p>Pana Sankranti also known as Maha Vishub Sankranti, is the traditional new year day festival of Buddhists and Hindus in Odisha, India. The festival date is set with the solar cycle of the lunisolar calendar, as the first day of the traditional solar month of Mesha. This is identical to the purnimanta system of lunar month Baisakh (on Indian national system, it is the 24th day of Chaitra). It therefore almost always falls on 14 April every year on the Gregorian calendar.</p>
            <p>The festival is celebrated with visits to Shiva, Shakti, or Hanuman temples, as the day is considered to be the birthday of Hanuman. People take baths in rivers or major pilgrimage centers. Communities participate in mela (fairs), watch street dance or acrobatic performances. A notable climax of the social celebrations is fire-walk, where volunteers sprint over a bed of burning coal while being cheered with music and songs. Feasts and special drinks such as a chilled sweet mango-milk-yoghurt-coconut drink called Pana is shared, a tradition that partly is the source of this festival's name.</p>

            <p>There are 6 events which are considered as the key activities of this annual spectacular event. 1. 'Snana Yatra' is the one where the Deities take bath and then fell sick for almost 2 weeks. They are thus treated with ayurvedic medicines and a set of traditional practices. 2. On 'Sri Gundicha', the Deities are taken in the onward car festival from the main shrine to the Gundicha Temple. 3. On the Bahuda Yatra, the return car festival, the Lords are brought back to the main Temple. 4. Suna Besha (Golden Attire) is the event when the Deities wear golden ornaments and give darshan from the chariots, to the devotees. 5. 'Adhara Pana' is an important event during Ratha Yatra. On this day sweet drink is offered to the invisible spirits and souls, who would have visited the celestial event of the Lords, as believed by the Hindu tradition. 6. And finally the Deities are taken back inside the main shrine i.e. the Jagannath Temple and installed on the Ratna Simhasan, on the last day of the Ratha Yatra activity which is called as 'Niladri Bije'.</p>

The fourth day is called Vasumati Snana, or ceremonial bath of Bhudevi. The term Raja came from Rajaswala (meaning a menstruating woman), and in medieval times the festival became more popular as an agricultural holiday marking the worship of Bhudevi, who is the wife of lord Jagannath. A silver idol of Bhudevi is still to be found in the Puri Temple beside Lord Jagannath .</p>

The day before first day is called Sajabaja or preparatory day during which the house, kitchen including grinding stones are cleaned, spices are ground for three days. During these three days women and girls take rest from work and wear new Saree, Alata, and ornaments.It is similar to Ambubachi Mela. The most popular among numerous festivals in Odisha, Raja[4] is celebrated for three consecutive days. Just as the earth prepares itself to quench its thirst by the incoming rain the unmarried girls of the family are groomed for impending matrimony through this festival. They pass these three days in joyous festivity and observe customs like eating only uncooked and nourishing food especially Podapitha, do not take bath or take salt, do not walk barefoot and vow to give birth to healthy children in future. The most vivid and enjoyable memories one has of the Raja gaiety is the rope-swings on big banyan trees and the lyrical folk-songs that one listens from the nubile beauty enjoying the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Lord Ganesha (Ganapati) is a well-known god for the Hindus. He is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. There can be no auspicious ceremony without the blessings of Lord Ganesha Puja. Hence there is a mandatory custom of worshiping Lord Ganesha before any auspicious work. Lord Ganesha is considered as the dispeller of the obstacles (vighna harta). As per Puranic stories, Lord Ganesha is easily pleased with devotion.</p>
            <p>This spectacular festival of Ganesh Chaturthi honors the birth of the beloved Hindu elephant-headed god, Lord Ganesha, popularly worshiped for his ability to remove obstacles and bring good fortune. The festival is celebrated in a very public manner. Local communities compete with each other to put up the most impressive Ganesha statue and display. Expect very crowded streets, filled with boisterous devotees, and lots of music.</p>
            <p>The festival begins with the installation of huge elaborately crafted statutes of Ganesha in homes and podiums, which have been specially constructed and beautifully decorated. Artisans put months of effort into making the statues. It's forbidden to look at the moon on this first night as legend had it the moon laughed at Lord Ganesha when he fell from his vehicle, the rat. On Ananta Chaturdasi (the last day), the statues are paraded through the streets, accompanied by much singing and dancing, and then immersed in the ocean or other bodies of water.</p>

            <img src="../images/demo/gallery/durgapuja.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
            <p>Durga Puja is a festival, which is observed for 10 days. The Durga Puja is celebrated in two different ways in Odisha. In Shakti peethas (temples of goddess) the Durga Puja is observed with proper rituals for 16 days, starting from Krishnapaksha Ashtami to Shukla paksha Navami of the Hindu Oriya Calendar, known as Shodasa dinatmak Upachara. The pandals are usually decorated beautifully.</p>
            <p>The festival of Durga Puja starts with Mahalaya, the first phase of the waxing moon in Aswin. Thousands offer prayers to their ancestors at the city's river banks or sacred ponds, a ritual called Tarpana. The inauguration of the Goddess idol starts on Mahashasthi. The main puja is for three days - Mahasaptami, Mahaastami, Mahanavami. The puja rituals are long and very detailed and complicated. Three days of Mantras and Shlokas and Arati and offerings - needs an expert priest to do this kind of Puja. Because of this, the number of Pujas privately conducted by families has lessened and Durga Puja has emerged as a community festival.</p>
            <header class="heading">Mahashashthi</header>
            <p>On this day Goddess Durga arrives to the mortal world from her heavenly abode, accompanied by her children. She is welcomed with much fanfare amidst the beat of traditional drums. Unveiling the face of the idol is the main ritual on this day. Bela Baran or Kalaparambha, the ritual performed before the commencement of the puja, precedes Chakshyu Daan, Amantran and Adhibas.</p>
            <header class="heading">Mahasaptami</header>
            <p>Saptami is the first day of Durga Puja. A tiny banana plant, or Navapatrika, is given a pre-dawn bath. This is an ancient ritual of worshiping nine types of plants. They are together worshiped as a symbol of the goddess. The main Saptami Puja follows Kalparambha and Mahasnan.</p>
            <header class="heading">Mahaastami</header>
            <p>The day begins with a recital of Sanskrit hymns, in community puja pandals, as thousands of devotees offer anjali to the goddess. Kumari Puja, or the worship of little girls as the child goddess, was a special part of the rituals observed in a number of traditional and household pujas. As the day continues, it is time for the important Sandhi Puja, which marks the inter-linking of the Maha Ashtami and Maha Navami. In recent times the Pani-Kakharu (White Pumpkin) sacrifice replaced animal sacrifice in various parts of the state.</p>
            <header class="heading">Mahanavami</header>
            <p>This is the concluding day of Durga Puja. The main Navami Puja begins after the end of Sandhi Puja. The Navami Bhog consisting fish is offered to the goddess. This is later partaken of as prasad[clarification needed] by the devotees. In the day of Navami the Oriya households organise Navami Bhoji (Navami feast) and invite friends, relatives. In this day they prepare typical Oriya delicasies (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items).</p>
            <header class="heading">Vijaya Dashami or Dussehra</header>
            <p>After the three days of Puja, in Dashami, on the last day, after the last ritual Aparajita Puja is offered to the Goddess, a tearful farewell is offered to her. The women offer Dahi-Pakhal (cooked rice soaked in water and curd), Pitha (baked cake), Mitha (sweets) and Fish fry to the goddess. Most of the community pujas prolong the farewell as long as possible, and arrange a grand send-off. The images are carried in processions known as Bhasani Jatra or Bisarjan Jatra around the locality and finally are immersed in a nearby river or lake. Vijoya Dashami is an event celebrated all over India. After the immersion of the idol, people across the state celebrate "Ravan Podi" (they burn the huge idol of Demon Ravana</p>

        <p>This festival is held in Odisha (a state in eastern India), in the city of Cuttack at Gadagadia Ghata of the Mahanadi river, to mark the day when ancient Sadhabas would set sail to distant lands of Bali.</p>

These toy boats, usually launched early in the morning contain traditional paan and small oil lamps, which are lit and placed inside them, to provide an attractive sight during the festival. People sing a song Aa ka ma boi, pan gua thoi... to remember the early maritime history of Odisha. The song tells about four months that are important for marine merchants of Kalinga (the earlier name of Odisha). This festival is also celebrated with great fanfare in Paradeep. Bali Jatra bears testimony to the rich maritime legacy of ancient Odisha. This is the specific time that was considered auspicious by the Sadhabas to begin their voyage in vessels called Boitas.

For such obvious reasons the eldest child is honoured to occupy the respectable place in the family after the death of the parents.'
